  <h2>About Us</h2>
<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>A group of Turkish students from different universities are inspired by Hyperloop Alpha paper and they establised Loopstr in summer of 2023– <em>a student initiative which focused on scalable Hyperloop technologies.</em></p>
<p>Loopstr is run by students who wants to make Hyperloop a viable option in transportation industry and logistic. To make that possible Loopstr follows the recent developements in the sector and works in R&amp;D activities.</p>
<p>The short term goals of Loopstr is being succesful in local and international competitions– <em>such as European Hyperloop Week.</em></p>
<h1>Hyperloop</h1>
<p>The world needs a new way of traveling that is faster and better than ever before. Elon Musk proposed the solution in 2013: a high-speed transport system that uses tubes with very low air pressure, where vehicles with cabins can move. Because of the low drag in the tubes, the vehicles can reach speeds of over 1000 km/h while using less energy, producing less emissions, and offering more convenience than planes.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Why Does It Matter?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can reach supersonic speeds,
by getting rid of the resistance from air and wheels, and achieve speeds over 1000 km/h (620 mph).</li>
<li>It is eco-friendly,
using renewable energy sources such as solar power to run the pods.</li>
<li>It is hassle-free,
with pods leaving every minute to various destinations, without long lines or delays.</li>
<li>It is secure,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of the system and its passengers.</li>
</ul>
